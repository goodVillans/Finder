College assignment: making use of github API to search and see users and various data related to their github profiles

Technologies used:

- React JS
- TailwindCSS
- DaisyUI
- Axios

3rd party API

- Github API

Student Developer notes:

Vite
   persisting errors working with CRA and Tailwind forced the use of Vite as an alternative to Hyperions recommended Build tool. Neccessary for the time constraints imposed by the college.

Tailwind & Daisy
   Use of Tailwind(framework) and DaisyUI(component lib) posed a unique learning curve as opposed to use of previous, higher-level styling frameworks (such as bootstrap)

Axios
   What motivated the use of axios after doing some research led me to believe that its use may cater more to industry standard applications (as opposed to the fecth api) for the following features:
      - Use of XSRF protection
      - default request and response interception
      - cancellation of requests(CancelTokens)
      - Request timeouts
      - Enhanced error handling: error status 400 &or 500 do not reject promise and still return success(eliminates use of response.ok)

React Hooks
   Additional learning and implementation of the following hooks not provided by HyperionDev:
      - useContext: allows sharing of data across components without passing through props(useful for passing props down multiple levels)
      - useReducer: management of complex state and state transitions in functional components using a reducer function. Useful when you have state that involves multiple sub-values.

Package Structure:

COMPONENTS

   LAYOUT
      alert: alerts when search field is empty
      navbar: global component
      footer: global component

   REPOS  
      RepoList: displays list of user repos
      RepoSingle: display for single repo in RepoList

   USERS
      Search: SearchBar component that initializes a get request for github users onSubmit.
      UserList: component displays users fetched from search.jsx > 'GET_USERS'
      UserItem: single user display in the context of UserList.jsx

CONTEXT

   GITHUB
      GithubActions: Exports two functions for searching GitHub users and fetching user data and repos with axios.
      GithubContext: Creates new context and  accompanying provider to be exported to manage Github related state.
      GithubReducer: Defines and exports a reducer function that manages GitHub-related state based on dispatched action types for users and repos.

   ALERT
      AlertContext: Creates new context and  accompanying provider to be exported to manage Alert related state.
      AlertReducer: Defines and exports a reducer function that manages Alert-related state based on dispatched action types for search.

PAGES
   Composed main site pages drawing from aforementioned childern components

.ENV
 .env file needs to be created and you will need to add your personal access token and the API url to it in order for this application to work.
